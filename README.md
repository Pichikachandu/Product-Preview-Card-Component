## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


### Links

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to structure a simple product preview card using a mobile-first approach with responsive CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts. I also improved on adding hover and focus states for buttons to enhance interactivity.

Some examples of code I'm proud of:

html
<h1>Product Preview Card Component Solution</h1>


css
.card {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
}




### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to further refine my skills in:

- Using CSS Grid more effectively for complex layouts
- Enhancing accessibility features, like screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- Exploring performance optimizations for mobile devices

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This article helped me understand Flexbox better and was instrumental in creating the responsive layout.
- [MDN Web Docs - Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - I referred to this guide frequently while working on the card's structure.
